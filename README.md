# DSL_and_MDE_in_Rust
Based on "Domain-Specific Languages: Effective Modeling, Automation, and Reuse" by Andrzej WÄ…sowski and Thorsten Berger.

I solved programming exercises in Rust instead of the other languages used in this book, such as Scala, Java and Python.

## Notes

* Written solutions are stored in the doc folder, while coded solutions are stored in the code folder.
* Solutions for the exercises in each chapter are stored in corresponding sub-folders.
* For Chapter 3, only exercises 3.1 to 3.12 have been solved, and exercises 3.13 to 3.34 have been skipped.
* For Chapter 4, exercises 4.48 to 4.50 and exercise 4.57 have been skipped.
* For Chapter 5, exercise 5.8 to 5.15, 5.17 to 5.52 have been skipped.
* For Chapter 6, exercises 6.3, and 6.6 to 6.22 have been skipped.
* For Chapter 7, exercises 7.1 to 7.16 have been skipped.
* For Chapter 8, exercises 8.1 to 8.3, and 8.5 to 8.20 have been skipped.
* For Chapter 9-13, all exercises have been skipped.
* These exercises were unnecessary or too excessive for me to study Domain-Specific Languages and Model-Driven Engineering in depth.
